# AirBnB Clone - RESTful API
This sub-project is a part of the AirBnB Clone project focusing on REST API.

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer.
It is an architectural style for designing web services. RESTful web services are stateless, meaning that each request contains all the necessary information to complete the request.

**API** stands for Application Programming Interface.
An API is a set of protocols and routines for building and interacting with software applications. APIs can be used to access data or functionality from a web application or service.

**CORS** stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
It is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent web pages from making unauthorized cross-domain requests. CORS allows servers to specify which origins are allowed to access their resources.

A **REST API** is a web service that uses the REST architectural style.
It allows clients to access and manipulate web resources using standard HTTP methods.
REST APIs are stateless and can be cached to improve performance.

**Types of APIs**
SOAP API: uses the Simple Object Access Protocol for exchanging structured information.
GraphQL API: provides a flexible query language and runtime for APIs.
Webhooks: allows a server to push information to a client in real-time.

**HTTP methods**
The HTTP method to retrieve a resource is GET.
The HTTP method to create a resource is POST.
The HTTP method to update a resource is PUT or PATCH.
The HTTP method to delete a resource is DELETE.

**Request a REST API**
To request a REST API, you need to send an HTTP request to the API endpoint.
The request should include the HTTP method, endpoint URL, and any necessary parameters.
The API will respond with an HTTP status code and any data requested or manipulated by the request.
